#Check off the tasks and continue
In order to keep track of the tasks that have been completed and those that are still pending, we need to update the TODO.md file. To do so, we can place an 'x' inside the brackets '[ ]' for each completed task. Once we have marked all the completed tasks, we can move on to the next step and continue the process until we have marked all the tasks in the list. This helps us keep track of our progress and ensures that nothing is left undone.
